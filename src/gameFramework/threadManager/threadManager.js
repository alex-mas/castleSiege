 * @description - implements methods of delegating work to workers and acts as intermediary between the requesting objects and the workers
 * 
 * @param {String} callerPath 
 * @param {String} relFilePath - relative file path from the current directory towards the file that implements the desired worker
 * @param {Object} config - (OPTIONAL) defaults to an empty object
 * @param {function} eHandler - function that takes one argument, the event, which will hold the data passed back by the workers on message broadcasting
 * 
 * 
 * @property {Object} config - Holds the configuration provided by the user
 * @property {String} callerPath - Holds the path provided by __dirname on the context of the caller
 * @property {String} relFilePath - Holds the relative path from callerPath to the file the user wants to execute the worker
 * @property {Number} amountOfWorkers - Determines how many workers will the thread manage
 * @property {Worker[]} workers - Holds references to all the workers being managed
 * @property {Number} lastAssignedWorker - Matches the index of the worker inside workers array that was assigned work more recently
 *
